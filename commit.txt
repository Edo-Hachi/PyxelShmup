Implement alternating left-right enemy entry patterns with wave-based random Y coordinates

## Features Added
- Added right_horizontal entry pattern to complement left_horizontal
- Implemented alternating wave entry (even rows: left, odd rows: right)
- Added wave-based random Y coordinate generation (64Â±32 range)
- Unified Y coordinates within each wave for formation cohesion

## Technical Improvements
- Fixed Y-coordinate drift bug in entry sequence processing
- Added comprehensive debug tracking for wave management
- Implemented enemy ID system (W0E00-W3E09) for detailed state monitoring
- Enhanced state transition logging for first and last enemies in each wave

## State Management
- Complete state flow: ENTRY_SEQUENCE â†’ MOVING_TO_HOME â†’ HOME_REACHED â†’ NORMAL
- Verified all 4 waves (40 enemies) complete proper state transitions
- Confirmed formation movement starts correctly after all waves complete

## Debug Features
- Added wave-based enemy identification and state transition logging
- Enhanced debug output for entry sequence monitoring
- Implemented detailed tracking for wave completion verification

This establishes a robust foundation for future complex entry patterns (loops, spirals, etc.)
and provides comprehensive debugging capabilities for wave management systems.
